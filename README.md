# thaenx

### About
thaenx is a simple Python program that sends YouTube livestream notifications to Discord servers.

Please do not use this program in it's current state, as it was only created for development purposes, and I am currently developing an alternative that uses YouTube's API.

### Installation and Usage
1. Download the thaenx repository
2. Install dependencies
```
pip install requests
```
3. Setup `config.py`
4. Add YouTube livestream to `broadcasts.txt`
5. Run `main.py`
